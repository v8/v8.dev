title: 'Merging & patching'
---
If you have a patch to the `master` branch (e.g. an important bug fix) that needs to be merged into one of the production V8 branches, read on.

The following examples use a branched 2.4 version of V8. Substitute `2.4` with your version number. Read the documentation on [V8’s release process](/docs/release-process) and [V8’s version numbering](/docs/version-numbers) for more information.

An associated issue on Chromium’s or V8’s issue tracker is mandatory if a patch is merged. This helps with keeping track of merges. You can use [a template](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/entry?template=Merge%20request) to create a merge request issue.

## What qualifies a merge candidate?

- The patch fixes a *severe* bug (in order of importance):
    1. security bug
    1. stability bug
    1. correctness bug
    1. performance bug
- The patch does not alter APIs.
- The patch does not change behavior present before branch cut (except if the behavior change fixes a bug).

More information can be found on the [relevant Chromium page](https://www.chromium.org/developers/the-zen-of-merge-requests). When in doubt, send an email to <v8-dev@googlegroups.com>.

## The merge process

The merge process in the Chromium and V8 tracker is driven by labels in the form of:

```
Merge-[Status]-[Branch]
```

The currently important labels for V8 are:

1. `Merge-Request-{Branch}` initiates the process, and means that this fix should be merged into `{Branch}`. `{Branch}` is the name/number of the V8 branch e.g. `7.2` for M72.
1. `Merge-Review-{Branch}` means the merge is not approved yet for `{Branch}` e.g. because Canary coverage is missing.
1. `Merge-Approved-{Branch}` means that the Chrome TPMs have signed off on the merge.
1. When the merge is done, the `Merge-Approved-{Branch}` label is replaced with `Merge-Merged-{Branch}`.

## Instructions for Git using the automated script

### How to check if a commit was already merged/reverted/has Canary coverage

Use `mergeinfo.py` to get all the commits which are connected to the `$COMMIT_HASH` according to Git.

```bash
tools/release/mergeinfo.py $COMMIT_HASH
```

If it tells you `Is on Canary: No Canary coverage` you should not merge yet because the fix was not yet deployed on a Canary build. A good rule of the thumb is to wait at least 3 days after the fix has landed until the merge is conducted.

### Step 1: Run the script

Let’s assume you’re merging revision af3cf11 to branch 2.4 (please specify full git hashes - abbreviations are used here for simplicity).

```bash
tools/release/merge_to_branch.py --branch 2.4 af3cf11
```

Run the script with `-h` to display its help message, which includes more options (e.g. you can specify a file containing your patch, or you can reverse a patch, specify a custom commit message, or resume a merging process you’ve canceled before). Note that the script will use a temporary checkout of V8 - it won’t touch your work space. You can also merge more than one revision at once; just list them all.

```bash
tools/release/merge_to_branch.py --branch 2.4 af3cf11 cf33f1b sf3cf09
```

In case you are a V8 committer, feel free to use `TBR` to land the merge if 1) it has approval and 2) the merge was clean and there are no conflicts to resolve.

### Step 2: Observe the [branch waterfall](https://ci.chromium.org/p/v8/g/branches/console)

If one of the builders is not green after handling your patch, revert the merge immediately. A bot (`AutoTagBot`) takes care of the correct versioning after a 10-minute wait.

## Patching a version used on Canary/Dev

In case you need to patch a Canary/Dev version (which should not happen often), follow these instructions:

### Step 1: Merge to roll branch

Example version used is `5.7.433`.

```bash
tools/release/roll_merge.py --branch 5.7.433 af3cf11
```

### Step 2: Make Chromium aware of the fix

Example Chromium branch used is `2978`:

```bash
git checkout chromium/2978
git merge 5.7.433.1
git push
```

### Step 3: The end

Chrome/Chromium should pick up the change when they build automatically.

## FAQ

### I get an error during merge that is related to tagging. What should I do?

When two people are merging at the same time a race condition can happen in the merge scripts. If this is the case, contact <machenbach@chromium.org> and <hablich@chromium.org>.

### Is there a TL;DR?

1. [Create an issue on the issue tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/entry?template=Merge%20request).
1. Check status of the fix with `tools/release/mergeinfo.py`
1. Add `Merge-Request-{Branch}` to the issue.
1. Wait until somebody adds `Merge-Approved-{Branch}`.
1. [Merge](#step-1-run-the-script).
