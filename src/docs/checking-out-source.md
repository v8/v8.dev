## Source code branches

There are several different branches of V8; if you're unsure of which version to get, you most likely want the up-to-date stable version. Have a look at our [[Release Process|Release Process]] for more information about the different branches used.

You may want to follow the V8 version that Chrome is shipping on its stable (or beta) channels, see <https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/>.
