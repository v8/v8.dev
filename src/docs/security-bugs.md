V8 fully uses [Chromium’s Security process](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security). In order to report a V8 security bug please follow these steps:

1. Check [Chromium’s guidelines for security bugs](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/reporting-security-bugs)
1. File a [new bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Security%20Bug) and add the component “Blink>JavaScript”.
