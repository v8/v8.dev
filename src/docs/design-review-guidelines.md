title: 'Design Review Guidelines'
---
Please make sure to follow the following guidelines when applicable.

There are multiple drivers for the formalization of V8's design reviews: 1.) Make it clear to Individual Contributors (ICs) who the decision makers are and highlight what the path forward is 2.) Create a forum to have straight-forward design discussions 3.) Reduce surprises on the Tech Lead (TL) layer 4.) Increase the involvement of all V8 contributors over the globe

## TL;DR;

Important: *1.) Assume good intentions 2.) be kind and civilized 3.) be pragmatic*

The proposed solution is based on the following assumption/pillars:

1. The proposed workflow puts the IC in charge. They are the one who facilitate the process.
1. Their guiding TLs are tasked to help them navigate the territory and find the right LGTM providers.
1. If a feature is uncontroversial, nearly no overhead should be created.
1. If there is a lot of controversy, the feature can be 'escalated' to the V8 Eng Review Owners meeting where further steps are decided.
