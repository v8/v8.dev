<h1>What is V8?</h1>

<p>V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome, Node.js and in Deno, among others. It implements <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">ECMAScript</a> and <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/">WebAssembly</a>, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.</p>
